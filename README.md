# Metal Chemist
**Metal Chemist** â€” 2 problems (***katas***) from **[codewars.com](https://www.codewars.com/)**.

These are problems about building and parsing notation of real-world molecules to our code. ***Memory administration, buddy***.

First problem is about building Molecule and Atom classes with functionaties, of course. **[Full Metal Chemist #1](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a27ca7ab6cfd70f9300007a)**.

Second is about parsing chemical notation to object in code. **[Full Metal Chemist #2](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a529cced8e145207e000010)**.

At that time we, me (**TheKoke**) and my friend (**Shyngys03**) solved only first problem. It is `prequel/` directory.
There is meaning of our files:
 File Name      | File Description
----------------|----------------------
atom.py         | File with implementation of `Atom` class.
molecule.py     | File with implementation of `Molecule` class.
errors.py       | File with certain python errors.
onefiler.py     | File for upload our solution to codewars. (They're allow only one file).
description.txt | Tasks and requirements of problem translated to russian.
tests.txt       | Basic tests from author of this problem.

Second part of problem in process..
